## Electronics
You will need a variety of electronics for this build, I will list the electronics that I have personally used.

For the microcontroller, i used the ESP32 Devkit v1 this allows me to send and receive stuff over wifi

I used a MAX98357 I2S DAC/Amp module for the speakers, so you dont need a seperate DAC and Amp module
